## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?


I write programs that are maintainable and adaptable by using clear structure, modular code, and meaningful comments so that others can easily follow the logic. For example, the CRUD Python module in Project One separated database operations from the user interface, which made it easier to update and connect to the dashboard in Project Two. This approach allowed for scalability and reuse, meaning the CRUD module could also support future projects requiring database interaction.


## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?


I approach problems by first analyzing client requirements and then breaking the problem into smaller, manageable tasks. For Grazioso Salvare, I identified the database and dashboard needs, then designed solutions step by step to meet those needs. This approach differed from earlier assignments because I focused more on real-world client expectations rather than just technical exercises, and in the future, I would continue using modular design and client-driven requirements when building databases.


## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?


Computer scientists solve problems by creating technology that improves efficiency, accessibility, and decision-making. In this project, my work enables Grazioso Salvare to quickly identify and categorize dogs for specialized training, ultimately helping save lives during rescues. By building tools like these, computer scientists empower organizations to achieve their missions more effectively and make a real-world impact.
